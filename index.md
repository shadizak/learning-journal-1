### Benefit from a growth mindset

__What is a growth mindset?__
A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

__Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset__

**1. Challenges**

When I’m faced with a challenging coding problem, I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it

***2. Obstacles**

In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Persig talks about the “gumption trap” – the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done, but lacking the motivation to do it.

**3. Effort**

So when I find myself reaching for the snooze button, I consider all this. I make a conscious effort to stop and think about the growth mindset

# This what I tell myself to clear my mind
1. If they can do it I can do better from them
2. The sweetness that I feel after I do a hard challenge this is the sweet I do love.
3. When I do something wrong, I tell myself that everyone does mistakes so I try to fix it and try not to fall in it again
